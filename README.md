# Lang v Lang
Language vs Language is the ultimate showdown where developers vote and debate their favorite programming tools in head-to-head battles. Cast your vote and see which language reigns supreme!

When you are on a voting page, click the "Vote" button of your favorite language as many times as you want! When you're done, click the "Cast" button to update the database with your newly cast votes.

On the voting pages, you'll see a textbox for your name. Here, you can enter your name or a group name. When you use a name, votes get registered under that name. Vote under a group name with your friends and compete on the leaderboard!
